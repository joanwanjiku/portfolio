                    <p>
                        I am a <em>Mathematics and Computer science graduate</em> . I majored in <strong>Mathematics</strong> coz I loved and excelled in it.
                        However, I did code for a while in campus and I'm hoping to do that fulltime after this program.

                        Previously, I worked as a Tech support Intern, mainly focusing on networking and user support.
